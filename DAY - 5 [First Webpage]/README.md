## 🧱 Basic Webpage Structure

Every webpage follows a standard structure. Think of it like building a house - you need a foundation, walls, and rooms organized in a logical way.

### 📋 The Essential Elements:

1. **DOCTYPE declaration** - Tells the browser what version of HTML we're using
2. **HTML element** - The root element that contains everything
3. **Head section** - Contains information about the page (metadata)
4. **Body section** - Contains the visible content

## 📝 The Paragraph Tag (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag is one of the most important and frequently used HTML tags. It's used to create paragraphs of text.

### 🔤 Basic Syntax:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

### 🎨 Key Features:

- Automatically adds space above and below the paragraph
- Can contain text, links, images, and other inline elements
- Block-level element (takes up full width available)

### 📖 Example Usage:

```html
<p>Welcome to my first webpage!</p>
<p>This is another paragraph with some important information.</p>
<p>Each paragraph is separated by default spacing.</p>
```
